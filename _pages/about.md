Hi! I am currently a PhD student in computer science at University of California, Santa Barbara. I am advised by Professor Elizabeh Belding and Arpit Gupta. I completed my masters from University of Cape Town, South Africa.

I have previously researched in the space of 5G mobile networks on the topics of cloud radio access network (CRAN), and infrastructure planning with machine learning. Currently, I am in collaboration with Viasat to investigate/improve video streaming QoE over geo-stationary satellite networks.

Please do not hesitate to contact me about research and other collaborations.
