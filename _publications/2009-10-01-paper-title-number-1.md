It is well documented that, in the United States (U.S.), the availability of Internet access is related to several demographic
attributes. Data collected through end user network diagnostic tools, such as the one provided by the Measurement Lab
(M-Lab) Speed Test, allows the extension of prior work by exploring the relationship between the quality, as opposed
to only the availability, of Internet access and demographic attributes of users of the platform. In this study, we use
network measurements collected from the users of Speed Test by M-Lab and demographic data to characterize the
relationship between the quality-of-service (QoS) metric download speed, and various critical demographic attributes,
such as income, education level, and poverty. For brevity, we limit our focus to the state of California. For users of the
M-Lab Speed Test, our study has the following key takeaways: (1) geographic type (urban/rural) and income level in an
area have the most significant relationship to download speed; (2) average download speed in rural areas is 2.5 times
lower than urban areas; (3) the COVID-19 pandemic had a varied impact on download speeds for different demographic
attributes; and (4) the U.S. Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC’s) broadband speed data significantly overrepresents the download speed for rural and low-income communities compared to what is recorded through Speed
Test.
