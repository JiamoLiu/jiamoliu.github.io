Data center in the fifth generation (5G) network will serve
as a facilitator to move the wireless communication industry from
a proprietary hardware based approach to a more software oriented environment. Techniques such as Software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) would be
able to deploy network functionalities such as service and packet
gateways as software. These virtual functionalities however would
require computational power from data centers. Therefore, these
data centers need to be properly placed and carefully designed
based on the volume of traffic they are meant to serve. In this work,
we first divide the city of Milan, Italy into different zones using Kmeans clustering algorithm. We then analyse the traffic profiles of
these zones in the city using a network operator’s Open Big Data
set. We identify the optimal placement of data centers as a facility location problem and propose the use of Weiszfeld’s algorithm
to solve it. Furthermore, based on our analysis of traffic profiles
in different zones, we heuristically determine the ideal dimension
of the data center in each zone. Additionally, to aid operation and
facilitate dynamic utilization of data center resources, we use the
state of the art recurrent neural network models to predict the
future traffic demands according to past demand profiles of each
area.
