Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is
a new architecture that has been proposed to enable
the current hardware to meet the ever-increasing traffic
demand, as well as reducing the energy consumption
of mobile base stations. This paper mainly focuses
on two components of C-RAN, namely Remote Radio
Heads (RRH) and Baseband Processing Unit (BBU)
pool. The method of association of these two components
could potentially affect the Quality of Service (QoS)
and energy consumption level of the system. The
connection between RRH(s) and BBU(s) is logical in
C-RAN, which means that the association of RRH(s)
to BBU(s) can be dynamically adjusted. Thus, a
BBU-RRH switching scheme is required to manage the
computational resource that the BBU pool possesses.
This paper proposes a switching algorithm that works in
conjunction with the knowledge of the traffic pattern of
an area. This algorithm not only reduces the number of
BBUs used in comparison with the traditional approach,
but also decreases the number of switches required while
maintaining a satisfactory level of service. In order to
achieve this, the proposed algorithm reduces or limits
the load of BBUs when the overall traffic of a BBU
is on the rise, and vice versa. Finally, the simulation
results illustrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the
switching complexity and improves QoS while achieving
significant reduction of BBU usage in comparison to
traditional RAN.
